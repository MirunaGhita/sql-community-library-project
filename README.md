## 📌 Project Overview

This project models and analyzes a community library management system using a relational SQL database.
It focuses on tracking books, members, loans, and borrowing behavior to support operational insights and reporting.

The database was designed to reflect real-world library processes such as book checkouts, returns, overdue tracking, and member activity analysis.


## 🔍 Analysis & Queries

**PART 1** - Contains beginner scenarios demonstrating SQL joins, aggregation functions, conditional logic, date calculations, string manipulation, and filtering/grouping techniques. It includes queries for analyzing book popularity, genre popularity, and member activity.

**PART 2** - Contains intermediate scenarios, including a smart book recommendation system, event ROI analysis, inventory management, and a member loyalty program. It demonstrates advanced SQL techniques such as JOINs, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** – SQL development and management  
- **DrawIO** – Architecture and data flow diagrams
